# 🔍 Entity Deduplication for Company Records — Veridion Internship Challenge

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains a complete solution to a real-world **entity deduplication problem** — identifying and merging duplicate company records from a noisy, incomplete, and inconsistent dataset.

The project was completed as part of the **Veridion Data Engineer Internship challenge**, and showcases a pipeline designed to be:

- **Fast** (optimized for running time with blocking, vectorization, and local computation)
-  **Robust** (handles missing, inconsistent, and messy data)
-  **Accurate** (smart scoring system for duplicate detection)
-  **Scalable** (can be extended to Dask, Spark, or GPU if needed)
